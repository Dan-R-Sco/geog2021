-----------------------------------


####<a name="Education">Educational Aims and Objectives of the Course</a>

 To enable the students to: 
 
+ Understand the nature of remote sensing data and how they are acquired
+ Understand different types of remote sensing instruments and their missions
+ Understand basic image representation and processing
+ Understand how Earth Observation data can be combined with other sources of data and data techniques (e.g. GIS)
+ Understand how EO data can be used in environmental science (particularly via classification and monitoring)
+ Develop practical skills in these areas, which may be useful in planning of dissertations
+ Develop links with the second year course on Geographic Information Systems Science and with othet courses as appropriate (e.g. hydrology, environmental systems)
+ Lay the foundations for the third year course on Earth Observation

####<a name="elsewhere">How to run the practicals elsewhere</a>

You can download all of the notes and practicals from this site.

To run the practicals, you will need access to [ENVI](http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/view/id/142?filter=envi) and the datasets associated with each practical.

Note that installing IDL/Envi is likely to take around 2.5 GB of space.

If you download ENVI, make sure you also download the [license file](http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/download/id/142/fileId/1539). If you install ENVI on your own computer, make sure you follow the instructions [on setting up the license server](http://www.exelisvis.com/Support/HelpArticlesDetail/TabId/219/ArtMID/900/ArticleID/4660/4660.aspx) after downloading the software and license file from the [UCL software database](http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk).

You can also run the practicals using [desktop@UCL Anywhere](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/desktops/students/desktop-anywhere)
